# TraceGuard

Open-source trust layer for AI coding agents. TRACEguard adds a lightweight governance layer around Claude Code and Codex CLI through project instructions, permission boundaries, hooks, structured logging, and optional verification passes.

The protocol is organized around five interventions:

| Letter | Intervention | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| **T** | Tool Boundaries | Prevent unsafe or unaccountable actions |
| **R** | Reason-Grounded Receipts | Auditable summaries of what the agent did and why |
| **A** | Abstention and Uncertainty | Mark low-confidence or unsupported claims |
| **C** | Challenge Pass | Verify risky or unsupported outputs before finalizing |
| **E** | Evidence Binding | Tie claims to repo evidence, tests, or external sources |

See [`TRACEguard_protocol.md`](./TRACEguard_protocol.md) for the full protocol and [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for the build plan.

## Quick start

```bash
# from inside a project repo
npx traceguard init        # scaffold .traceguard/, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md
npx traceguard on claude   # wire up .claude/settings.json hooks
npx traceguard on codex    # inject AGENTS.md block + recommend codex sandbox
npx traceguard status      # show current activation state
```

After an agent session ends, inspect the receipt:

```bash
npx traceguard receipt latest
npx traceguard verify      # force a challenge pass against the latest receipt
```

To remove TRACEguard:

```bash
npx traceguard uninstall          # reverse all marker-block edits
npx traceguard uninstall --purge  # also delete .traceguard/
```

## Command reference

Every command runs against the **current working directory's repo root** (walks up to the nearest `.git` or `package.json`). All file edits TRACEguard makes are wrapped in HTML-comment sentinels so they can be reversed cleanly.

### `traceguard init`

Scaffolds the TRACEguard layout in the current repo.

**What it does:**

- Creates `.traceguard/{logs,receipts,policies,hooks}/`
- Writes `.traceguard/config.json` with the default policy (Level 0–3 thresholds, challenge mode = `static`, secret redaction on)
- Inserts the protocol block into `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` between `<!-- TRACEguard:start blockId=protocol -->` and `<!-- TRACEguard:end blockId=protocol -->`. If those files don't exist, they're created with just the block. User content outside the markers is never touched.
- Adds `.traceguard/.gitignore` so per-session logs aren't committed by default (receipts and config are committable).

**Usage:**

```bash
traceguard init           # idempotent — safe to re-run
traceguard init --force   # re-write the TRACEguard config and blocks
```

Run this **once per project**. After it succeeds, run `on claude` and/or `on codex`.

---

### `traceguard on claude`

Activates TRACEguard for Claude Code in the current repo.

**What it does:**

1. Ensures `.traceguard/config.json` exists.
2. Inserts (or refreshes) the `CLAUDE.md` protocol block.
3. Installs three executable hook shim scripts in `.traceguard/hooks/`:
   - `pre-tool-use.sh` → invoked before every Bash/Edit/Write/MultiEdit
   - `post-tool-use.sh` → invoked after every tool
   - `stop.sh` → invoked when the agent session ends
4. Merges TRACEguard-tagged entries into `.claude/settings.json` under `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop`. Existing user-defined hooks are preserved — TRACEguard's entries carry an internal `__traceguard__` marker so `off` removes exactly them.
5. Sets `agents.claude.enabled = true` in config.

**Usage:**

```bash
traceguard on claude
```

After this, your normal `claude` session in this repo will be governed by TRACEguard — risky commands are classified and either logged, prompted, or blocked, and a receipt is written at session end.

---

### `traceguard on codex`

Activates TRACEguard for Codex CLI in the current repo.

**What it does:**

1. Inserts (or refreshes) the `AGENTS.md` protocol block.
2. If `~/.codex/config.toml` exists, idempotently injects a marked block setting `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` and `approval_policy = "on-request"`. If it doesn't exist, prints the recommended block to stdout instead of writing anything you didn't opt into.
3. Sets `agents.codex.enabled = true` in config.

**Usage:**

```bash
traceguard on codex
```

> Codex coverage is best-effort: without a Claude-Code-style hook API, TRACEguard relies on the `AGENTS.md` instructions plus the sandbox/approval defaults to keep risky actions surfaced.

---

### `traceguard off claude`

Reverses `on claude`.

**What it does:**

- Removes the `CLAUDE.md` protocol block (between its sentinels).
- Removes only the TRACEguard-tagged hook entries from `.claude/settings.json`. Any hooks you added yourself stay put.
- Sets `agents.claude.enabled = false`.

**Usage:**

```bash
traceguard off claude
```

`.traceguard/` (config, logs, receipts) is **not** deleted — use `uninstall --purge` if you want a clean slate.

---

### `traceguard off codex`

Reverses `on codex`.

**What it does:**

- Removes the `AGENTS.md` protocol block.
- Removes the TRACEguard-marked block from `~/.codex/config.toml` (if present), preserving the rest of your Codex config.
- Sets `agents.codex.enabled = false`.

**Usage:**

```bash
traceguard off codex
```

---

### `traceguard status`

Shows the current TRACEguard state for the repo.

**What it prints:**

- Repo root
- Claude Code: `active` / `inactive`, plus whether the `CLAUDE.md` block is present, whether `.claude/settings.json` exists, and whether hook shims are installed
- Codex: `active` / `inactive`, plus the configured `sandbox_mode` and `approval_policy`
- Active policy (`default` / `strict` / `custom`)
- Challenge mode (`static` / `self` / `reviewer`)
- Reviewer mode on/off
- Path to the most recent receipt (or `(none yet)`)

**Usage:**

```bash
traceguard status
```

Use this to confirm `on`/`off` actually took effect.

---

### `traceguard receipt latest`

Prints the Markdown of the most recent session receipt to stdout.

**Receipts contain:**

- Files changed (path, change type, `+N/-N` line counts) from `git diff HEAD`
- Commands run (with risk level and exit code)
- Tests detected and their result
- Approvals (Level 2 ask-and-approved, Level 3 blocked)
- Evidence list (claims bound to `test_result`, `diff`, etc.)
- Uncertainties + recommended verification steps
- Whether a challenge pass was triggered, and why

**Usage:**

```bash
traceguard receipt latest
```

Receipts live in `.traceguard/receipts/` as `<timestamp>-<session-id>.{json,md}`.

---

### `traceguard receipt list`

Lists every receipt in the repo, most recent first.

**Usage:**

```bash
traceguard receipt list
```

Each line is `<ISO timestamp>  <path>`. `CHALLENGE.md` (the self-challenge prompt) is excluded.

---

### `traceguard verify`

Forces a challenge pass against the latest receipt, regardless of whether it would have been triggered automatically.

**What it runs:**

1. **Static challenge** (always):
   - Scans the working diff for security-sensitive paths (`auth/`, `payments/`, `migrations/`, `.github/workflows/`, etc.)
   - Runs the secret regex set over each changed file **and** over the added lines in its diff
   - Re-runs `config.commands.lint` and `config.commands.typecheck` if those are declared and were not already run in the session
   - Surfaces failed tests, blocked Level 3 actions, and threshold breaches (default: > 5 files or > 300 lines)
2. **Self-challenge** (if enabled and static result is not `passed`): writes a `CHALLENGE.md` prompt into `.traceguard/receipts/` that the agent should address on its next turn.
3. **Independent reviewer** (if `reviewer_mode: true` in config): shells out to `claude -p` with the receipt JSON for an external `PASS` / `WARN` / `BLOCK` verdict. Best-effort — silently downgrades to `SKIPPED` if `claude` isn't on PATH.

**Usage:**

```bash
traceguard verify
```

Exit code is `2` on a block verdict, `0` otherwise. Useful as a pre-merge step.

---

### `traceguard uninstall`

Removes TRACEguard from the repo by calling both `off` flows.

**What it does:**

- `off claude` (removes `CLAUDE.md` block + `.claude/settings.json` entries)
- `off codex` (removes `AGENTS.md` block + Codex TOML block)
- Without `--purge`: leaves `.traceguard/` so your historical receipts and config survive.
- With `--purge`: deletes `.traceguard/` entirely (config, logs, receipts gone).

**Usage:**

```bash
traceguard uninstall          # remove integrations, keep history
traceguard uninstall --purge  # remove integrations AND wipe .traceguard/
```

---

### `traceguard --help` / `traceguard --version`

Standard commander output. `--help` works on any subcommand too:

```bash
traceguard --help
traceguard init --help
traceguard receipt --help
```

---

## Typical workflow

```bash
# one-time setup in a project
cd ~/code/my-project
traceguard init
traceguard on claude

# work normally — Claude Code is now governed by TRACEguard
claude

# after the session, check what happened
traceguard receipt latest

# before merging anything risky
traceguard verify
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
node bin/traceguard.js --help
```

This package targets Node 20+. See [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for the phase-by-phase build that produced the current tree.
